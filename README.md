# 🏥 Multimodal Disease Prediction System  
Machine Learning | Computer Vision | NLP  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project is a Machine Learning-based system that predicts diseases using two different input modalities:

- 📝 Symptom-Based Prediction (NLP + ML)  
- 🖼 Image-Based Prediction (Computer Vision + Transfer Learning)  

The system integrates both models into a unified pipeline with a custom-built GUI application for real-time predictions.

Users can:
- Enter symptoms manually  
- Upload a medical image  
- Get instant prediction results with confidence score

## 🧠 Model Architecture  

### 1️⃣ Text-Based Disease Prediction  

- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)  
- TF-IDF vectorization  
- Machine Learning models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine (Final Selected Model)  

✅ **Accuracy Achieved: 97%**

---

### 2️⃣ Image-Based Disease Prediction  

- Transfer Learning using ResNet50  
- Image preprocessing & augmentation  
- Fine-tuned classification layers  
- Softmax output layer  

✅ **Accuracy Achieved: 85%**

## 🖥 GUI Application  

A custom Python-based GUI was developed to:

- Accept symptom input  
- Upload disease images  
- Display prediction results  
- Show prediction confidence  
- Provide user-friendly interaction  

The GUI integrates both models into a single interface.
