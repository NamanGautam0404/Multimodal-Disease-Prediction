## Project Overview  

This project is a Machine Learning-based system that predicts diseases using two different input modalities:

-  Symptom-Based Prediction (NLP + ML)  
-  Image-Based Prediction (Computer Vision + Transfer Learning)  

The system integrates both models into a unified pipeline with a custom-built GUI application for real-time predictions.

Users can:
- Enter symptoms manually  
- Upload a medical image  
- Get instant prediction results with confidence score

## GUI Application  


A custom Python-based GUI was developed to:

- Accept symptom input  
- Upload disease images  
- Display prediction results  
- Show prediction confidence  
- Provide user-friendly interaction  

The GUI integrates both models into a single interface.
